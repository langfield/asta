Shape annotations for homogeneous numpy arrays and pytorch tensors.
Based on the excellent 'nptyping' package by Ramon Hagenaars.

Todo
----
- Add ``# type: ignore`` comments in test files. The ``[type-arg]`` and
  ellipses errors will be ignored when the package is installed. They just need
  to be silenced within the package itself. (DONE)
- Delete ``demo.py``. (DONE)
- Implement ``-1`` wildcard shape element suppport. (DONE)
- Add tests for ``Tensor``. (DONE)
- Write examples in README.
- Add tests for empty arrays and tensors.
- Add reprs.
- Fix tensor strategy.
- Add an option to disable typechecked decorator (default=disabled, ``.astarc`` file).
- Add tests for ``@typechecked``.
- Consider changing name of decorator to ``@shapechecked``.
