Shape annotations for homogeneous numpy arrays and pytorch tensors.
Based on the excellent 'nptyping' package by Ramon Hagenaars.

Todo
----
- Add ``# type: ignore`` comments in test files. The ``[type-arg]`` and
  ellipses errors will be ignored when the package is installed. They just need
  to be silenced within the package itself.
- Delete ``demo.py``.
- Implement ``-1`` wildcard shape element suppport.
